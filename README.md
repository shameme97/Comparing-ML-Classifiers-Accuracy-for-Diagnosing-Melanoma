# Comparing-ML-Classifiers-Accuracy-for-Diagnosing-Melanoma
This project focuses on comparing the performance of different Machine Learning Classifiers in diagnosing Melanoma accurately in patients from an existing dataset ```Melanoma TFRecords 256x256.csv``` in the Pandas library. It also compares the performance of Support Vector Machine, Neural Network (MLPClassifier) and Random Forest classifiers before and after performing dimensionality reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

### Machine Learning Classifiers:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machine
* Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
* Random Forest 

### Libraries:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Sklearn
* Matplotlib

### Editor:
* Jupyter Notebook
